This is an incremental step - you should have the following finished:

Your site has navigation! Most of the time this means a nav-bar or some sort.
Your resume is complete, or very close to complete
Your site has styling - this will likely come from a combination of styles from your CSS framework (if applicable) and your own personal stylesheets.
We <3 the 90's but your styling shouldn't look like it's from then
Your site includes icons/buttons/links to appropriate social media such as LinkedIn or Github.
Your Github profile page links to your portfolio
Any images, animations, or effects load in a reasonable amount of time
Your site doesn't have a flash of unstyled content (this is where you see the HTML without the CSS for a split second, and is usually due to slow-loading images or JS)
The font style and size are easily legible and professional looking (no comic sans unless using it ironically)
No obvious CSS, HTML, or JS bugs
You will want to be at this point before your final project is due, so you may still have a placeholder for at least one of the projects. That's okay! You don't need to invent a time machine! Just make sure it's as close to ready as it reasonably can be.
